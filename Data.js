Everyone thought it will get a clean U certificate, but surprisingly, it got an adults only certificate. However, the producers have not yet received the show-cause noticeOMG 2 is slated for an August 11 release, but the song that was released after the executive committee of the CBFC watched the film, had the release date missing from it.

      description:"Isn’t it wonderful that there are researchers out there whose job is quite simply to make a robotic bird? That’s certainly the goal of this lab, whose flapping-wing drone, or ornithopter, has now been equipped with a grasping claw to let it take a rest on a nearby branch or perhaps even a finger — a capability that could make it a much more practical tool.There’s a good reason flight evolved over time, making use of flapping wings — they’re a lot simpler for a bird or insect to grow than rotors or jets, for one thing. Elegance is a hallmark of nature’s designs, and winged creatures fly or glide with a minimum of energy and a great deal of grace.It should be no surprise that scientists have been at pains to re-create winged flapping flight in robotic form for decades, though, like all biomimetics research, meeting with mixed success. But the École Polytechnique Fedérale de Lausanne — one of Switzerland’s famous technical universities — and the University of Seville are doing quite well.",

    description:"Muscle fatigue is a complex phenomenon – during exercise, muscles contract and generate force through a series of intricate interactions between nerve impulses and fibers, utilizing energy. One of the primary contributors to muscle fatigue is the depletion of energy stored within the muscle cells.Creatine compounds act like a store house from which ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is delivered to the muscles. ATP is the energy stored in the muscles which fuels their contractions.“When muscles get tired it means energy in the form of ATP is depleted,” adds Dr Sundar. “Throughout repetitive muscle movement, the muscles contract and relax. There are two filaments, actin and myosin present in the muscles which pull each other during contractions. While pulling together they need ATP which is stored in the form of creatine. When you exercise, these filaments just keep on pulling and retracting and they hit a limit.”",

One has to ensure the different muscle groups and parts of the body get a workout through the weekly schedule while rest, diet including an appropriate combination of vitamins with carbohydrates and proteins along with fitness levels should all be taken into account in the plan. And while the main muscle groups, functionally and aesthetically speaking (the likes of abs, chest, thighs, arms etc.) get the attention, some important muscle groups oft get neglected. The forearms, for instance, whose strengthening is important to increase grip strength, is commonly overlooked.Grip strength, say experts, is not just important for grabbing and lifting in the gym, but for many sports activities as well as functional tasks and chores. While grip strength could be measured and quantified thraough a hand dynamometer, its role in physical exertions, and in the human kinetic chain, is significant and not quite fathomable.",

For instance, if you require 2,000 calories per day, the average person on a crash diet only consumes around 600–700.”In addition, the exclusion of certain food groups results in inadequate nutrition that can eventually lead to deficiencies.“Rather than making you healthy and fit, crash diets steer you in the opposite direction,” says Gauri Murthy, a wellness and sports nutrition specialist from Mumbai. “When the body does not receive proper nutrients, there’s a loss of lean tissue [which breaks down easily] and muscle mass, not the fat components themselves. This can cause water loss in the body, resulting in weakness along with low energy and stamina levels. Also, because you are losing muscle mass rather than fat, your skin may sag, and your body may lack definition and appear unhealthy.”",

However, when a break in training happens, the body’s requirement of energy is much less and the excess calories, which are not utilized, get stored in the body as fat.Loss of muscle mass exacerbates the situation. “If one stops exercising, there can be a reduction of muscle mass in the body,” says Lavanya Parashivakumar, physiotherapist and exercise physiologist at Even Healthcare Pvt.

      description:"Carbohydrates are macronutrients which play an important role in the human body. Apart from acting as an energy source, they also help in blood glucose and insulin metabolism. Carbohydrates are stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen. During resistance training, muscle contractions rely primarily on aerobic glycolysis for energy. A depletion in glycogen could limit performance. Excessive glycogen depletion can lead to muscle fatigue by lowering ATP synthesis, and endurance exercise in a glycogen-depleted state can reduce muscle protein synthesis. “Omission of carbohydrates or taking fewer carbs can result in muscle loss and lack of energy for the body,” says Nagesh Rao, master fitness trainer at Rockwall Fitness, Bengaluru. “The absence of carbs will result in muscles having less cell volume, which will further result in the shrinkage of the muscles and thus a reduction in their mass.

While Bhaji is a traditional Indian name for a vegetable dish, the Pav or Pao was the Portuguese word for bread, which was introduced by them during their brief presence in Mumbai around the mid-1500s.The origin of this dish traces back to textile mill workers in Mumbai in the 1850s. They had lunch breaks too short for a full meal, and a light lunch was preferred to a heavy one, as the employees had to return to strenuous physical labor after lunch. The dish was invented to fulfill the requirements of lunch for those textile mill workers. They needed cheap, easy, quick-to-prepare, and light, yet nutritious food. A vendor created this dish using items or parts of other dishes available on the menu. Roti (a bread) or rice was replaced with pav, and the curries that usually go with Indian bread or rice were amalgamated into just one spicy concoction: the “bhaji.” It also became a favorite late-night street food. Since then, it has been neatly absorbed into Indian fast food, soaking up the butter and spicy curry that Indians love.Bhaji is made from a tasty and nutritious blend of vegetables, including potatoes, cauliflower, peas, carrots, and onions.  It is blended with bhaji masala, a mix of spices that is similar to chaat masala but a little hotter.The bhaji is served with Pav – soft, buttery buns.",

Achaya, references in the Sangam literature suggest that dosa was already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the 1st century CE.[3] Achaya states that the earliest written mention of dosa appears in literature of present-day Tamil Nadu, in the 8th century, while the earliest mention of dosa in the Kannada literature appears a century later.In popular tradition, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with Udupi restaurants.[4] The Tamil dosai is softer and thicker. The thinner and crispier version of dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka.[5] A recipe for dosa can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka",

They are often salted and may be served with ketchup, vinegar, mayonnaise, tomato sauce, or other local specialities. Fries can be topped more heavily, as in the dishes of poutine, loaded fries or chili cheese fries. French fries can be made from sweet potatoes instead of potatoes.

It is better known as Bidadi (Ramanagara district, between Mysuru and Bengaluru express highway), Thàtte Idli as it originated in Bidadi town.Idli rice and urad dal are soaked in water for several hours. Once they get soft, the rice and dal is ground till they form a smooth batter. Idli batter is left overnight to ferment. Fermented batter almost doubles in volume with lots of air bubbles. Next day, salt is added and batter is spread on special purpose plates- the size of Thàtte Idli and steam cooked for 15-20 minutes in moderate flames. Now, thàtte idli is ready to be served.One single Thàtte idli equals 2-3 regular size idlis in terms of volume. Hence though a plate of Thàtte idli costs more than normal idli, This idli is very fulfilling.",

      description:"As for the Himalayan momo, it is not quite known whether it spread from the Kathmandu valley of Nepal to Tibet or the other way around. Because this dish was initially popular among the Newar community of the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, one prevalent belief is that traveling Nepali Newar merchants took the recipe from Tibet, where they traded, and brought it home to Nepal.[14] Some argue that momo was introduced in Tibet by a Nepalese Newari princess who was married to a Tibetan king in the late fifteenth century, since in Newari, one of Nepal's oldest languages, ‘mome’ means cooking by steaming.[13] In Tibet, the filling of the dish was typically meat, such as yak and occasionally potatoes and cheese. Traditional Tibetan momo is quite different from the Nepalese one as the former was made with a thicker dough and with little to no spices except salt. However, after arriving in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, the meat became chicken, and mixed vegetables momo was introduced to feed the large population of vegetarian Hindus.[15] A large number of Tibetans emigrated to India following the 1959 Tibetan uprising, bringing their recipes for momos with them.[3] Unproven, but substantiated by the dates and references to momo in colloquial references, the civil war in Nepal pushed out the Nepali diaspora to seek a livelihood in India, which further increased the prevalence of Himalayan style momo in the southern half of India especially in the cities of Chennai and Bangalore.",

      description:"The origin of ramen is traced back to Yokohama Chinatown in the early 20th century. The word ramen is a Japanese borrowing of the Chinese word 拉麵 (lāmiàn), meaning 'pulled noodles'. The dish evolved from southern Chinese noodle dishes, reflecting the demographics of Chinese settlers in Yokohama. Ramen gained popularity in Japan, especially during food shortages following World War II. In 1958, instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando, further popularizing the dish. Today, ramen is a cultural icon in Japan, with many regional varieties and a wide range of toppings.The last few decades have seen a proliferation of regional ramen variations in Japan, known as gotouchi ramen. Notable examples include Sapporo's rich miso ramen, Hakodate's salt-flavored ramen, Kitakata's thick, flat noodles in pork-and-niboshi broth, Tokyo-style ramen with soy-flavored chicken broth, Yokohama's Ie-kei ramen with soy flavored pork broth, Wakayama's soy sauce and pork bone broth, and Hakata's milky, pork-bone tonkotsu broth. Ramen is offered in various establishments and locations, with the best quality usually found in specialist ramen-ya restaurants. Ramen's popularity extends beyond Japan, as it is known as rìshì lāmiàn in China, ramyeon in Korea, and has even made its way into Western restaurant chains. Instant ramen was exported from Japan in 1971 and has since gained international recognition.",
